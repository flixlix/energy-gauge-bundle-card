## Goal

This card aims to offer a customizable gauge visualization for Home Assistant that displays various types of information, such as "autarky" or "self-consumption". If you have a new idea on a new `gauge type` feel free to submit a Feature Request, explaining the new type, or even better, a Pull Request, implementing this type.

> What's the difference from this card to the official Gauge Card?

Compared to the original Gauge Card, the main advantages of this card are its customizability and the ability to sync with the energy date selection, ensuring dynamic information updates over different periods of time. Most important of all, this card shows different types of information, that are otherwise simply not accessible from the official cards.

## Recommendation

If you would like to customize the Energy period selector and its dates, I recommend using this card: [Energy Period Selector Plus](https://github.com/flixlix/energy-period-selector-plus)

## Install

### HACS (recommended)

This card is not direclty available in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store), but can be added using "Custom Repositories".
_HACS is a third party community store and is not included in Home Assistant out of the box._
To install this:

- Go to HACS
- Click on `Frontend`
- Click on the overflow Menu (three vertical dots)
- Click on `Custom Repositories`
- Type this URL [https://github.com/flixlix/energy-gauge-bundle-card](https://github.com/flixlix/energy-gauge-bundle-card)
- In "Category", select `lovelace`
- Install via UI

<details>  <summary>Manual Install</summary>

1. Download and copy `energy-gauge-bundle-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/flixlix/energy-gauge-bundle-card/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.

2. Add the resource reference as decribed below.

### Add resource reference

If you configure Dashboards via YAML, add a reference to `energy-gauge-bundle-card.js` inside your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/energy-gauge-bundle-card.js
    type: module
```

Else, if you prefer the graphical editor, use the menu to add the resource:

1. Make sure, advanced mode is enabled in your user profile (click on your user name to get there)
2. Navigate to Settings -> Dashboards
3. Click three dot icon
4. Select Resources
5. Hit (+ ADD RESOURCE) icon
6. Enter URL `/local/energy-gauge-bundle-card.js` and select type "JavaScript Module".
   (Use `/hacsfiles/energy-gauge-bundle-card/energy-gauge-bundle-card.js` and select "JavaScript Module" for HACS install if HACS didn't do it already)

## Using the card

To configure this card, only the type is required, making it very easy to get started.
